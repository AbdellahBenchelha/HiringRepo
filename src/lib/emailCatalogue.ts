/**
 * Every email this application sends, rendered with sample data, for reading.
 *
 * Read-only by design. The templates are code — they are reviewed and
 * committed like everything else — and a panel that let somebody retype an
 * offer email in a text box would be a second, unreviewed source of truth for
 * words that promise people money. What a recruiter needs is to see exactly
 * what a candidate will receive, and that is all this is.
 *
 * Rendered through the real template functions and the real formatting
 * helpers, never through copies. A preview built from hand-typed strings would
 * drift from the email the moment somebody changed either, and the whole value
 * of this page is that it cannot disagree with what actually goes out.
 *
 * Adding a template means adding it here. The test suite checks every
 * exported `…Html` function in emailTemplates has an entry, so a new template
 * cannot quietly be missing from the page.
